Creating Restaurant Review App
Within Web.Config file the database name in Initial Catalog and AttachDBFilename can be changed and you can add your local data source.
When the project runs automatically database is created. Though already I have sent my database in AppData folder.
The first page that opens up is "Index" page. Rest are connected to it.
