Creating Restaurant Review App
Within Web.Config file the database name in Initial Catalog and AttachDBFilename can be changed and you can add your local data source.
When the project runs automatically database is created. Though already I have sent my database in AppData folder.
The first page that opens up is "Index" page. Rest are connected to it.
The application is running successfully. Still if you find any issues please let me know.
I have used Visual Studio 2013 to develop it and it runs in IIS EXPRESS. I created my database in SQL SERVER.
I used Entity FrameWork for database connection. My Web API service is talking to MVC client.
MVC action methods(In Home Controller) will call the WEB API controllers and generate the views.
These are the high level details of my Project. For any further explanations please connect with me.
Added a new branch for pull request
